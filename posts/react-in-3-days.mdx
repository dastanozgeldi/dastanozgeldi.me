# What is React?

React is a Frontend Framework for building component-based applications.

In market, a skill such as React is really appreciated. Lots of services use React on the front and, to be honest, their products look awesome. That's when I decided to learn react.

# How did you start?

At the beginning it was really tough. I went to the official docs, went through the tutorial, but didn't understand the structure of this library, didn't really like it. That was **4-5** months ago.

Last week, scrolling through YouTube, I noticed a **12-hour Scrimba** tutorial hosted by **FreeCodeCamp**. Somehow, I got a strong drive to pass the course.

First 2 hours were really easy, but then I had to switch to Scrimba's original website where the screencast-based course was hosted.

The teaching method was marvelous, the course offered a built-in text-editor with autocompletion, challenges and quizzes.

After 2 days I finished the course, completing 140+ challenges and 10-ish projects on my learning folder.

So, you definitely have to check [this course!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8)
